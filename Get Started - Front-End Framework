Popular Front-End Frameworks

Front-End Framework
Frameworks abstract the interaction with the browser and DOM. With the use of frameworks, we are provided a skeleton. The question of the difference between libraries and frameworks comes up. Essentially libraries are tools that you can use when trying to solve a bigger problem. For instance, in R, you can use the igraph library to help you with network analysis. Frameworks, however, streamline the process of making something. Frameworks have a definite output. With libraries, I can decide what I want to create, but with the use of different frameworks, the output is definite.
